Project Milestone 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of the Application: Dragon Slayer
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, people are just too busy deciding what to eat for their meals or there are too many options for them. Now you may need someone to give you professional suggestions on what to eat. Our web application is exactly what you need.
Target Audience: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The target audience are the ones who have trouble deciding where to go for eating. Target audience doesn’t have to be a certain group of people. Instead, people of various age and occupations can find it beneficial. Our application will give them possibly good choices for restaurants. 
How we Reach the Minimum Requirement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This website meets the minimum requirements in the following ways. Users can create accounts in order to get the service. It provides information for users to read. Users can update by changing their profile(like preference of food or nickname) and posting comments on restaurants. Users also can delete their comments and profiles. If the user is not satisfied with one certain recommendation, he/she can click on “next” and get the information of next one without reloading the page. This is where AJAX take into effect.
What Makes our Application Unique:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Our application is not just a ranking system(for example, Yelp),  it apply data mining techniques(which is implemented by us) to analyze people’s information(like age, home and work address, food preference) and give suggestions on which restaurants they may like. The recommendations are generated based on the user's preference. It firstly asks users to create an account. When creating profile, the users are asked to provide their username, location, hobbies, and age(optional). After logging in, the users will be given a survey asking what type of cuisine they desire. Then, the website will randomly present a restaurant with detailed information(address, phone number, picture, etc) according to the user's’ selection.
